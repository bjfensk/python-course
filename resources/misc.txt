## How to disable middle click function within the Linux operating system.  
## This is useful when your mouse pointing device has a scroll wheel that performs as a middle button.
## In the terminal program,
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
[NOTE: Throughout this document, after each command line (e.g. "xmodmap....10", above), press the {Enter} key.]

## If you want to make a script for easy running:
## In the terminal, go to the desktop:
cd ~/Desktop

## Write the command into a file:
echo 'xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"' > disable-middle-click.sh

## Make that file executable:
chmod +x disable-mid-click.sh

# Now, you may run the file:
disable-middle-click.sh

################################

## To re-enable middle click:
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"

When the computer is rebooted, most likely it will revert to a state in which the middle click function of the scroll wheel/middle button is enabled.
