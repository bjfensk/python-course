1. Make a word guessing game. The user should be able to continue guessing until guessing the word correctly (regardless of uppercase/lowercase). Every time the user guesses, you should display how many guesses the user has taken so far. Give special messages after certain guesses -- for example, after the third guess, say "Three strikes, you're out! Just kidding, you can keep guessing." _Note: For extra fun, use the Python `termcolor` module._

2. Make a number guessing game. Give the user feedback with each guess: "Too high" or "Too low".
