Most people are familiar with these four operators: +, -, *, /

In this exercise, you'll learn some other useful operators.


```python3
## 1
## Ask the user for two numbers.
## Display "If you divided ___ by ___, then you would get ____ with a remainder of ___".
## You'll want the modulus operator. Look up how to do remainder (or modulus) in Python.
## You may also want the floor division operator.


## 2: Calculating an exponent
## Ask the user for two numbers.
## Display "If you computed ___ to the power of ___, then you would get ___."
## (Hint: What is the operator for exponent in Python? It may not be what you think.)


## 3: Operators that may not do what you expect
## Based on question #1, does % calculate a percentage? (Answer: No)
## Based on question #2, does ^ calculate an exponent? (Answer: No)

```

Let's also explore some more advanced uses of the assignment operator, that is, the equals sign:

```python3

## 4
## Try this. As you can see, it's possible to reassign variables.
x = 3
print("Currently, x is...")
print(x)
x = 4
print("Now, x is...")
print(x)


## 5
## Try this. It's a little counter-intuitive.
x = 3
print("Currently, x is...")
print(x)
## You should read the line below as "Set x to 5 more than what x used to be."
x = x + 5
print("Now, x is...")
print(x)


## 6
## Python provides another equivalent way to do this:
x = 3
print("Currently, x is...")
print(x)
x += 5
print("Now, x is...")
print(x)

```
