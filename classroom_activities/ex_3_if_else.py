## INTRODUCTION
So far we have been instructing a computer through Python programing to execute a series of commands without any decisions being made as the program runs.  But, computers and the Python language can do so much more.

In a basic definition, a computer is a machine that can make decisions.  In contrast, a pure calculator evaluates mathematical functions but cannot make decisions (1).  So, if a computer is useful for making decitions, how do we progam it to do so?  ...I'm glad you asked.

First, let's consider: How do we make a decision?  Wait, take one step back.  WHY do we make decisions?  As we live, work, or play, we make decisions when confonted with multiple options of what to do next.  For example, while riding a bicycle you may come to a fork in the road.  You cannot travel both directions simutaneously.  Which way will you (should you) choose? --Now we are discussing "HOW to make a decision".--  Maybe you have mental instructions based on past experience,  maybe a friend has advised you to go left or right, maybe you have a map, or maybe you notice one path is well worn from frequent use while the other path appears much less traveled. So, you consider the options based on your knowledge, your preference, or pre-established rules.  You then make a decision and direct the bicycle down the chosen path.  

To reminice for just a momement, I recall coming to a fork in the road several years back.  Initially unsure which way to go, I ultimately chose the path less-traveled, and it has made all the difference (2).

Back to computers.  One way to make decisions in a programming language such as Python is by using if-statments. We can use if-statements to compare a recently obtained value against a known value or range of values.  Based on the result of comparison, the if-statment chooses whether to perform another operation or to skip it.  
* When an else-statement follows an if-statement, the computer can choose between performing a first operation or a second operation.  For example, the first operation may be a calculation, and the second operation may be to print a message.  
* In addition, one or more elif-statements can be positioned between an if-statement and an e-else statement to choose between more than two options or operations.

The exercises below will allow you to understand how to use if-statements, and ideally, how to appreciate them.

## EXERCISES ------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1
## Try this. Run it more than once.
import random
randomNumber = random.randint(5, 8)
print(f"Here's a random integer: {randomNumber}")

## 1b
## Copy and modify the above example so that the computer will 
## pick numbers between 1 and 4 instead.


## 1c
## Try this. Run it a few times.
import random
randomNumber = random.randint(5, 8)
print(f"Here's a random integer: {randomNumber}")
if randomNumber == 7:
    print("I think some people say that number is lucky.")


## 1d
## Copy and modify the previous example so that the computer
## will pick numbers between 7 and 10 instead.


## 1e
## Copy and modify the previous example so that if the randomly
## chosen number is 10, it will say "Wow, a two digit number!"


## 2
## Try this.
import random
name = random.choice(["bob", "susan", "joe", "anna"])
print(f"Hey {name}.") 
if name == "joe":
    print("Your name rhymes with low.") 
     

## 3
## Copy and modify the above example so that "dell" is one of the names
## that can be randomly chosen.

## 3b
## Copy and modify the above example so that 
## if the name is "dell", it will print "Thatâ€™s a computer brand." 
     

## 4
## Try this.
import random
age = random.randint(18, 24)
print(f"Pretend that you are {age} years old.")
if age < 21: 
    print("You can't drink alcohol in the US yet.") 
else: 
    print("You are legally allowed to drink. Drink responsibly ðŸ˜Š ") 
     

## 5
## Copy and modify the above example so that the legal drinking age is 40. (Just to be funny.) 


## 6
## Try this.
thename = input("What is your name? ")
if thename == "george":
    print("Are you named after the first US President?")
else:
    print("Hello.")


## 6b
## Change the previous example so that if the user types "bob", it will reply "Are you the painter?"


## 6c
## Try this. Notice that it will ask for input. 
name = input("What is your name? ") 
if name == "joe": 
    print("Your name rhymes with low.") 
else: 
    print(f"Hey {name}.") 

 
## 7
## Modify the above example so that if the name is "cobb", it will say "Thatâ€™s a Ft Gordon building!" 


## 7b
## You'll notice that the user must type joe lowercase. Here's how to make it so any capitalization works:
name = input("What is your name? ").lower()
if name == "joe": 
    print("Your name rhymes with low.") 
else: 
    print(f"Hey {name}.") 


## 7c
## Try this. What do you think the != operator means?
name = input("What is your name? ").lower()
if name != "jay": 
    print("Your name is not Jay.") 
print("Greetings.")

    
## 7d
## Copy and modify the previous example like so:
## - Ask the user for a name
## - If the name is anything other than bob, then display "I don't think I know you. I only know Bob."

    
## 8 
## Try this. 
age = 10 
ageNextYear = age + 1 
print(ageNextYear) 
     

## 9
## Try this. Note: you will get an error. 
age = input("How old are you?") 
ageNextYear = age + 1 
print(ageNextYear) 
     

## 10 
## Try this. 
age = int(input("How old are you?")) 
ageNextYear = age + 1 
print(ageNextYear) 


## 11
## Copy and modify the previous example to do the following: 
## - Ask the user for age 
## - Say "I see you are __ years old. You will be 65 years old in __ years."
##   For example, if the user typed 45, then it would display
##      "I see you are 45 years old. You will be 65 years old in 20 years."


## 12
## Try this. Note: you will get an error. 
age = input("How old are you?") 
if age < 21: 
    print("You can't drink alcohol in the US yet.") 
else: 
    print("You are legally allowed to drink. Drink responsibly ðŸ˜Š ") 
     

## 13
## Modify the above example so it works. Youâ€™ll use the `int` function. 

 
## 14
## Copy and modify the above example so that it shows how many years remain until you can drink (but only display that if youâ€™re under the drinking age). 


## 15
## Write a program that takes a name from the user. If the name is the letter "A", say "Your name is just the letter A? Thatâ€™s kinda cool".  Otherwise, say "Ok, your name is ___". 
     

## 16
## Try this: 
birthyear = int(input("Type a year: ")) 
if birthyear < 2000: 
    print("You were born before 2000.") 
elif birthyear == 2000: 
    print("You were born in 2000.") 
else: 
    print("You were born after 2000.") 

    
## 16b
## Try this:
name = input("What is your name? (type it lowercase please.)")
print("Ok, let me look up that name...")
if name == "bob":
    print("That name used to be common, I think.")
elif name == "sue":
    print("Your name also refers to a legal action.")
elif name == "rob":
    print("Another abbreviation for robert, correct?")
elif name == "lacy":
    print("Does the origin of your name relate to clothing with lace?")
else:
    print("I don't know you.")
print("Done.")

          
## 16c
## Try this. How is it different from the previous example?
## (The difference is subtle, so ask if you are unsure.)
name = input("What is your name? (type it lowercase please.)")
print("Ok, let me look up that name...")
if name == "bob":
    print("That name used to be common, I think.")
if name == "sue":
    print("Your name also refers to a legal action.")
if name == "rob":
    print("Another abbreviation for robert, correct?")
if name == "lacy":
    print("Does the origin of your name relate to clothing with lace?")
else:
    print("I don't know you.")
print("Done.")


## 17
## Here's an example of using separate if statements (instead of using elif):
name = input("What is your name? (type it lowercase please.)").lower()
print("Ok, let me look up that name...")
if name.startswith("z"):
    print("Your name starts with a Z. That is somewhat uncommon in English.")
if len(name) < 3:
    print("Your name is less than 3 characters long.")
if len(name) > 9:
    print("Your name is more than 9 characters long.")
if name == "":
    print("Your name is empty!")

 
## 18
## Ask the user how many French fries they want. Display different responses depending on how many they request. (Examples: "Thatâ€™s way too many!", etc.) 

 
## 19
## Try this. Did it print what you expected?
x = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
if x < 20: 
    print("A") 
    print("B") 
print("C") 


## 20
## Copy and modify the previous example so that C is only printed if the number is not less than 20.
## Use the `else` keyword.


## 20b
## Copy and modify the previous example so that it acts like this:
## if x is less than 20, then print A.
## Otherwise, print C.
## After all of that is done, print Goodbye (regardless of what x was.)


## 21
## Ask the user for a number.
## If the user gives a number more than 50, 
##    then ask "What is your name?"
##    and display "Hello" followed by the name.
## If the user gives any other number,
##    then ask "How did you pick that number?"
##    and regardless of what they say, display "I see."
## After all of that, say "Have a good day."


## 22
## Write a program that takes a number from the user.
## Display the number doubled.
## Then do a sequence of creative if statements of your choice.
##   For example, if the number is negative, display "Really? Negative? Interesting".


## 22b
## Try this.
firstcost = int(input("How much is the first thing you bought? "))
secondcost = int(input("How much is the second thing you bought? "))
total = firstcost + secondcost
discounted = total * 0.9
print(f"The total cost would be {total}.")
print("However, we're doing a special sale today, so you get a 10% discount.")
print(f"That means you actually pay {discounted}")


## 23
## Try this.
x = float(input("Type a number between 0 and 1, for example, 0.3, 0.25, etc... "))
print("One more would be {x + 1}.")

## As you can see, you can use `float` instead of `int` when dealing with non-whole numbers.
## Sidenote: 
## (this sidenote is outside the scope of the class, but good to know)
## Using floats can cause weird rounding errors. For example:
print(1.03 - .42)
## This will print 0.6100000000000001.
## That's quite important when doing comparisons:
if .1 + .1 + .1 == .3:
    print("This will not print.")
else:
    print("This will print... what is math??")
## The reason is because the numbers are converted to binary behind the scenes.
## For more info, see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
## If you plan to eventually do any "real-life" programming, then it's definitely worth reading.
## (end of sidenote)


## 23b
## Ask the user for the cost of a single item and the quantity purchased. Print the total cost. 
## Make sure this works for non-integer costs. For example, try a cost of 2.30 and quantity of 2.
## Hint: You'll use float instead of int.
## Example:
## What is the cost for an item? 2.30
## How many did you buy? 2
## The total cost would be $4.60.


## 24
## Modify the previous example so that the shop gives a discount of 10% if you buy at least 20 of an item.  
## For example, if one item costs $5, and youâ€™re buying 20, total cost would be $90. 
     

## 25
## Ask the user for a number. Print the absolute value of the number without using the abs function. 


## 26
## Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius, and display the temperature in Fahrenheit. 


## 27
## Same as previous example, but backwards. 


## 28
## Combine the two previous examples: ask the user for a number and which way to convert.
