## Sometimes, you want to print with some specific format.
## For example:
##  - Rounding a number to two decimal places
##  - Padding a number with spaces so that it aligns with other numbers in a list

## For example:
item_number = 27.283
print(f"My item num is {item_number}.")
print(f"My item num is {item_number:10} and I put some space with it.")
print(f"Rounded would be {item_number:.2f} with two decimal places.")
