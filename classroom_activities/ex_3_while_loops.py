## 1
## Try this.
count = 10
print(f"count is {count}.")
count += 1
print(f"I changed count. Now, it's {count}.")
count -= 2
print(f"I changed it again. Now, it's {count}.")


## 2
## Modify the above example so it asks the user for a number.


## 3
## Try this.
count = 3
print(count)
count -= 1
print(count)
count -= 1
print(count)
count -= 1
print("Reached zero. Proof:")
print(count)


## 4
## Let's make the previous example less repetitive.
## Try this:
count = 3
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
print("Reached zero. Proof:")
print(count)



## 5
## Modify the previous example to let the user pick where to start the count.


## 6
## Modify the previous example to display
## "Launch in 3"
## "Launch in 2"
## "Launch in 1"
## "Liftoff!"

## 7
## Try this:
import time

print("Start...")
time.sleep(1)
print("Done.")

## 8
## Modify the previous example to let the user pick the number of delay seconds.

## 9
## Modify the earlier "Liftoff" example to add a small delay to make it more fun.
## (It should wait a second after each number is displayed.)
