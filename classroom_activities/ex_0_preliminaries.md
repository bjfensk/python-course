## Things to know:

### On the keyboard:

- `Ctrl /`: toggle comment / uncomment  (while lines are selected)
- `Backspace`: erase to the left
- `Delete`: erase to the right
- `Home`: Cursor to beginning of line
- `End`: Cursor to end of line
- `Shift arrowkey`: Highlight forward/backward/up/down
- `Ctrl arrowkey`: move cursor by words

Notes about `Delete`:
- In the "Terminal" program, the cursor is a box.  The `Delete` key deletes the character inside the cursor box and pulls text from the RIGHT.
- For many other programs, the cursor is a line that sits between two characters.  In this case, the {Delete} key deletes the character on the RIGHT side of the cursor and pulls text from the right.
