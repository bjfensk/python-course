      ```
      Bob Smith

      Mona Jones
      ```
2. Add some more names to the file.
3. Use Python to do the following:
   1. Open the file
   2. For each name:  
        1. If the name contains a space:
           1. Try using `.split()`.  
           2. Construct an username like so: Bob Smith would be "bsmith", etc
           3. Display " ____ 's username is ____ "
        2. If the name does not contain a space:
           1. Display " ____ 's username is ____ " (with the same name in both blanks).
