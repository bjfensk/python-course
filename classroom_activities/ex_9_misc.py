# 1
# Prompt the user for a string. Print the last three characters using string indexing.


# 2
# Modify the previous question to print “Mike” if the last three characters are MHz, and “Golf” if the last three characters are GHz.
# If the last three are neither of these, print “No match”.


# 3
# Prompt the user for a string. Print all of the characters EXCEPT the last three characters.


# 4
# Prompt the user for a number with MHz. (example input: 2463 MHz.) Print the numerical part. You may assume the user formats the input correctly, but you cannot assume the length of the number.


# 5
# Modify the previous question so that it converts the given number from MHz to GHz.


# 6
# Prompt the user for a string that contains letters and numbers. Print only the number digits. Hint: use isnumeric. Look up how that function works, then ask for help as needed.


# 7
# Prompt the user for a word, then display it reversed. (For a challenge, don’t use the built-in function for reversing things.)
